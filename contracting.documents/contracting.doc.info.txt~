Security Aggreements:
url : http://www.wordtemplates4u.org/security-agreement.html
============================================================================
When a lender and orrorwr enter in to a deal that involves
money/loan, intertest and repayment of the the loan,
there are always some chances and possibilities that one
of them might not stick to the rules and conditions
as provided and agreed by both of them.  In order to 
secure the rights and protect their assets


In order to secure the rights and protect their assets, 
the lender or the financial firm requires some kind
of security from the borrowr which ismost liekly
a real estate property that the bank pledges or in simple words,
keeps as security of safe return of loan from the borrower.  The agreement
that is signed by the lender and borrower to pledge the property
is known as the security agreement.


Brief Description of Security Agreement:
--------------------------------------------

In most cases, a guarantor is required to get the loan from 
a bank but some banks and financial firms also pledge real estate
property as the security for the safe return of the debt.

The security agreement is the legal document that is signed between the bank an debtor that
includes the details of the proerpty and permission fro the owner to pledge
the property of the bank.


Technology Assignment Agreement Template:
http://www.wordtemplates4u.org/technology-assignment-agreement-template.html
==============================================================================
When a client or company appraocahes a technology firm and hires 
it to develope a new technology, until the product has been developed and delivered
to the satisfaction of the client, the legal rights and owershp of the
technology remains withthe developer company.  When the client makes
the final payment to the firm andt's time to transfer of ownership of the
technology to the client, an agreement is written and singed between the
client and the developer compnay that concludes that the client has 
paid the adequate and agreed upon compensation..then the pertenant technology
and all rights and ownership is then transferred tothe client.


Technlogy Assingment(TAA) description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology may be considered to be femeral or efemeral....including hardware, software
research, etc.   All of these may be taken legal ownership off by some entity, along with
all established rights thereof.  This is basically a NDA of sorts

The technology assignment agreement is made between the shareholder and the 
corporation, where the shreholder assigns(selss, transfers, conveys, etc.) intellectural
property to the corporation.  A typical technology assignment agreement will list the IP
to be assigned to the corporation on an exhibit to the agreement, with the shareholder
representing he or she is the sole owner of the IP.  Additionally, the shareholder will
agree to execute all necessary documents to 
effectuate the IP transfer(e.g. documents with the USPTO...which I doubt many of them go about
actually doing.....)

The technology assignemt agreemtn is usually rferrred to in the stock
purchase agreement, as an IP transfer to the corporation can be consideration
(full or partial) for the stock purchased by the shareholder.  Keep in mind that 
technology assgnment agreements deal with IP that ws
create by the IP owner before the ownder became a shareholder of the corporation
(sucha s IP created by founder pre-incorporation)

Invention Assingment Agreement
================================================================================
While the technology transfer agreement takes care of pre-incorporation IP,
the  invention assignment agreement works to assign IP created by founders post-incorporation
over to the corporation.  Many startups overlook this document, but it can be sueful
to put the terms of each co-founder's employment in writing.  I can help set the tone
and manage expectations of efach co-founder.

Charter
================================================================================
File a charter with the secrtary of state and get yor starup incorporated.
There's nothign sexy sabout this document(for now), except that you
authorize the amount of your corporation's shares and set par value.  Yet
the charger is important because it creates the entity that will hold the IP
your team is developing.  Addtionally, it's difficult to make big-boy
corporate maneuvers like issuing stock options and raising capiptal without
incorporating.

Bylaws
=================================================================================
Who get's to vote? How are board resolutions passed ? how are officers electedc ?
The byloaws determine the coporate governance of your startuy\p, as they are the
rules and regulations for the corporation's internal adminstrations and managment.  Startups
often fail to draft bylaws, as bylaws are not required nor submitted to the 
secretary of state.  Don't be one of these starups unless you are 100% certain
there are going to be no corporate covernance issues(Ha! there will always be issues just as
long as there is stupid, craven, rapacious, selfish people)
