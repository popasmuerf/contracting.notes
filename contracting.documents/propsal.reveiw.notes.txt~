What to expect
=================================================

I will need to provide the following
--------------------------------------------------------
    -   Inclusion of Project Overview
    -   Obstacles
    -   System architecture
    -   Technology Requirements(software and hardware)
    -   Milestones (including Man Hours)
    -   Deployment and testing
    -   Documentation, Warreanty, Support Training
    -   Pricing, payment terms
    -   Contract details
    
    
Inclusion of Project Overview and Obstacles
=================================================    
Include a detialed descripton of the project
stating :

    -   Aims
    -   Scope
    -   Intended operation
    -   Design process
    -   Functionality(feature set)
    -   Technology involed in implimentation of design
    -   Details pertaining to distribution of software
    -   Software user capacity
    -   IP Ownership
    -   Testing
    -   Support warranty
    
  
  
Hardware
=====================================================
List hardware proposed for this project.
This includes any IaaS, or on prem virtualization/IaaS
Mobile, embedded/appliance hardware is also included here.
Be explicite...even though Apple's crap is x86/64...make
sure to mention this(both client and server, network nodes, etc)



Software
=======================================================
List all software technologies that will be
used in the development of the propsed
software as well as all software that will be
integreated with the system, fore ache one
try to explain why it was chosen.  For Example
"MS Office which is the industry-standard word processing
and spreadsheet software." and "Software coded in Java EE
is a future-proof language which runs in a VM and so can be implemented
easily across platforms including new hardware architectures".
Where there is a choice of equally valid software
technologies you should list the options
Note:Propreitary technology is not furture proof.  It will discontinue
as soon or shortly after the owner of the IP decides it is no longer in its
interest to support said IP.
    
    
Obstacles
=================================================
Include here your description of what you currently
conscider the possible risks involved in the software
development and thought about how you will 
managethen.  The aim here is to provide the impression
that you are under control and as positive as possible,
while providing a realistic  assessment of any and all concerns.
For each obstical or risk, or problme, explain why 
it is not a major issue and outline how your company plans
to mitigatte the risks( here function point analyiss may 
seem appropiate here...)  

Technical obsticals
-------------------------------------------------------
This section includes possible issues regarding 
integration of different systems, and again...an explination
of technology that would mitigate the risks involved.
Again...be positive but clear


Industry and Market Risks
-----------------------------------------------------------
This may include technology that is becomming outmoded
during development or after launch or a decrease in 
the userbase of a core poart of the software (i.e. FaceBook
apps are dependeant upon Facebook users).  For each
risk explain about mitigation through best practice
development, future-proofing and, if applicable, modular
developement(This is all largely an issue of perception.....does
it really matter at this point if the tech is still en-vouge or not?  Only that
it is extant, and supported in the foreseeable future)

Budgetary Risks
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This section would include missed deadlines and project
budget overruns.  Explain here how milestone and reporting 
processes will mitigate this risk(Agile iterrative development
with FULL stake-holder involvement...only in the usuability
and acceptance prototyping and testing...they have NO say
in the implimenation)

Note:  A SWOT(Strengths Weaknesses Opprotunities)  analysis might be in order here....



Milestones and Reporting
=======================================================================
This area is one which will be very specific tot he project you are creating
but please see the below example which shows the common stages:


1. Analysis
2. Development
3. Testing
4. Deployment
5. Training
