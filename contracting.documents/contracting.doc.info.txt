the lender or the financial firm requires some kind
of security from the borrowr which ismost liekly
a real estate property that the bank pledges or in simple words,
keeps as security of safe return of loan from the borrower.  The agreement
that is signed by the lender and borrower to pledge the property
is known as the security agreement.
