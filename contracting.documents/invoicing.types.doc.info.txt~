Invoicing
=================================
    *   Intermin invoices from work in Progress(WIP)
        -   are used to generate invoices without relieving any time or 
            expenses from WIP
    *   Final invoices(WIP)
        -   from WIP are used to releive time or expenses from WIP
    *   Proposed Invoices(WIP)
        -   are normally crated for review an dapproval purposes only.  Once approved, a proposed
            invoice can be changed to an interim or final invoice
    *   Miscellaneous invoices
        -   are used to bill clients outside of WIP
            (i.e. when there are no time or expense entries from which to bill
            the client)
    *   Interest invoices
        - used to charge clients for over due invoices
        (likely this needs to be worked into the contract)
        
    *   Recuring invokces
